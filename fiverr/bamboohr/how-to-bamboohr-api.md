# How to get employee data from BambooHR API: BambooHR Integration Guide

## I. Introduction

BambooHR is a popular cloud-based human resource management software that helps businesses manage their HR operations, including employee data management, onboarding, performance tracking, and more. In addition to its user-friendly interface, BambooHR also provides an API that allows developers to programmatically access and manipulate employee data.
Employee data is a critical component of HR operations, providing valuable insights into employee performance, engagement, and overall organizational health. With the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision making, businesses are looking for ways to harness the power of employee data to drive growth and productivity.
In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide to using the BambooHR API to retrieve and manage employee data. We will cover the basics of setting up a BambooHR account, using the API to retrieve employee data, and integrating the API with other applications. We will also discuss best practices for managing employee data, including privacy and security considerations, data protection laws, and keeping employee data up-to-date. Whether you are a developer, HR professional, or business owner, this guide will help you get the most out of the BambooHR API for your organization.

## II. Setting up a BambooHR account

To get started with using the BambooHR API, you'll first need to set up a BambooHR account and enable **API access**. Here's how:

### 1. Signing up for a BambooHR account:

To sign up for a BambooHR account, go to the BambooHR website and click on the "Get Started" button. Follow the instructions to set up your account. You'll need to provide some basic information, such as your company name, email address, and password. You'll also need to select a pricing plan based on the number of employees in your organization and the features you need.

### 2. Creating an API key:

Once you have a BambooHR account, you can create an API key to access the API. To create an API key, log in to your BambooHR account and navigate to the "API Keys" page in the "Account" section. Click on the "Add a New Key" button.
You'll need to provide a name for your API key, which will help you identify it later. You can also choose the level of access you want to grant to the API key. BambooHR provides three access levels:

- System Administrator: This access level provides full access to all BambooHR data, including the ability to create and delete users and change system settings.
- HR Administrator: This access level provides access to all HR data, but not system data. HR Administrators can manage employee data, but cannot make system-level changes.
- Reports Only: This access level allows read-only access to employee data and reports.
  Once you've selected the access level, click on the "Generate Key" button to create your API key. You'll be provided with a unique API key, which you'll need to include in your API requests.
  Understanding API access levels:
  It's important to understand the access levels provided by BambooHR's API, as they determine the level of access granted to the API key. Depending on your use case, you may need to choose an access level that provides the appropriate level of access. For example, if you're building an application that needs to read employee data, you may only need "Reports Only" access. However, if you're building an application that needs to create or update employee data, you'll need "System Administrator" or "HR Administrator" access. Be sure to choose the appropriate access level based on your needs.
  III. Using the BambooHR API

1. Overview of API endpoints for employee data: The BambooHR API provides various endpoints for employee data, including:

- Employee information: This includes data such as the employee's name, email address, job title, department, and other personal information.
- Job information: This includes data such as the employee's job title, job description, start date, and other job-related information.
- Time off: This includes data such as the employee's vacation, sick days, and other time off.
- Company directory: This includes data on all employees in the company, including their contact information and job titles.
- Reports: This allows you to generate reports on employee data, such as a report on employee turnover or employee performance.

2. Authentication methods: To access the BambooHR API, you need to authenticate your requests using an API key or OAuth2.0.

- API key: An API key is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate your requests to the BambooHR API. To obtain an API key, you need to go to the BambooHR API documentation and follow the instructions for generating an API key.
- OAuth2.0: OAuth2.0 is a standard protocol for authentication and authorization. To use OAuth2.0, you need to create an OAuth2.0 client in the BambooHR API console and obtain an access token. You can then use this access token to authenticate your requests to the API.

3. Best practices for API usage: To use the BambooHR API effectively, it's important to follow best practices, such as:

- Use caching: To improve performance, you can cache responses from the BambooHR API. This reduces the number of requests made to the API and can improve your application's performance.
- Use pagination: When requesting data from the BambooHR API, use pagination to limit the number of records returned in each request. This reduces the amount of data transferred and can improve performance.
- Handle errors: The BambooHR API returns errors in JSON format. Your application should handle these errors gracefully and provide useful error messages to the user.
- Monitor usage: Monitor your application's usage of the BambooHR API to ensure that you don't exceed rate limits or other usage restrictions.
- Follow API documentation: Follow the BambooHR API documentation and best practices to ensure that your application is using the API effectively and efficiently.

IV. Getting employee data using the API

### Retrieving All Employees Information

```python
import requests

subdomain = 'syncflowsolutions'

# Replace {subdomain} and {api_key} with your BambooHR credentials
url = f"https://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/{subdomain}/v1/employees/directory"

headers = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Basic ZTgyOGU3YzUyNGRlNmNkMmMxZTc0YWUxNDY1YmI0NDQ5NmY0YjVhNTpKRDg2UXA4ZS4qTHNKUXA="
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    employee_data = response.json()
    # Do something with the employee data
    print(employee_data)
else:
    print('Error retrieving employee data')

```

The code snippet above will retrieve records for all employees from the feature called directory.

**Pit fall to avoid**

> This common pitfall to avoid involves the use of the Company Directory feature. While this feature can be managed and disabled by individual companies in their account settings, it can lead to issues when calling the corresponding endpoint. This is because the feature may be disabled, or its behavior may vary across different companies. Instead, the recommended approach is to use the "request a custom report" API to retrieve bulk employee data, which is a more reliable and consistent method.

### Retrieving employee information

To retrieve information about a specific employee, you can make a GET request to the `https://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/{companyDomain}/v1/employees/{id}/` endpoint, where `{id}` is the ID of the employee you want to retrieve and `{companyDomain}` is the comapny subdomain.

This endpoint allows you to retrieve employee data by specifying a set of fields. It is ideal for retrieving basic employee information, including current values for fields that are part of a historical table such as job title or compensation information.

Here's an example using Python requests library:

```python
import requests

# Set the API URL and headers
subdomain = 'syncflowsolutions'

# Replace {subdomain} with your BambooHR credentials
id = 0
url = f"https://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/{subdomain}/v1/employees/{id}/"
headers = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Basic ZTgyOGU3YzUyNGRlNmNkMmMxZTc0YWUxNDY1YmI0NDQ5NmY0YjVhNTpKRDg2UXA4ZS4qTHNKUXA="
}

# Specify the fields to retrieve and only retrieve current data
params = {
    "fields": "firstName,lastName",
    "onlyCurrent": "true"
}

# Send the GET request and print the response
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
if response.status_code == 200:
    employee_data = response.json()
    print(employee_data)
else:
    print("Error retrieving employee data")

```

This retrieves the data for the employee with ID 0. Make sure to replace `{subdomain}` with your actual BambooHR credentials.

## Creating a new employee

To create a new employee, you can make a POST request to the `https://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/{companyDomain}/v1/employees/` endpoint.

The endpoint allows for the addition of a new employee. It is mandatory to provide at least the first and last names of the new employee. Upon successful creation, the ID of the newly created employee can be found in the response's Location header.

Here's an example using Python requests library:

```python
import requests


subdomain = 'syncflowsolutions'

# Replace {subdomain} and {api_key} with your BambooHR credentials
url = f"https://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/{subdomain}/v1/employees/"

payload = {
    "firstName": "Tiberius",
    "lastName": "Mairura"
}
headers = {
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Basic ZTgyOGU3YzUyNGRlNmNkMmMxZTc0YWUxNDY1YmI0NDQ5NmY0YjVhNTpKRDg2UXA4ZS4qTHNKUXA="
}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print(response.text)
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as error:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {error}")
except Exception as error:
    print(f"An error occurred: {error}")

```

This creates a new employee with the specified data. Make sure to replace `{subdomain}` with your actual BambooHR credentials.

### Updating employee data

To update an existing employee's data, you can make a PUT request to the `/employees/{id}` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the updated employee data.
Here's an example using Python requests library:

```python
import requests

id = 134
url = f"https://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/syncflowsolutions/v1/employees/{id}/"

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Basic ZTgyOGU3YzUyNGRlNmNkMmMxZTc0YWUxNDY1YmI0NDQ5NmY0YjVhNTpKRDg2UXA4ZS4qTHNKUXA="
}
payload = {
    "firstName": "Tiberius .O",
    "lastName": "Mairura"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print('Employee updated successfully!')
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

```

This updates the data for the employee with ID 134 with the specified data. Make sure to replace `{subdomain}` with your actual BambooHR credentials.

### Handling pagination

When retrieving large amounts of employee data, the BambooHR API will paginate the results. You can handle pagination using the page and per_page parameters.
Here's an example using Python requests library:

```python
import requests

# Replace {subdomain} and {api_key} with your BambooHR credentials
url = 'https://{subdomain}.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/{api_key}/v1/employees?per_page=50'
page = 1
while True:
    # Request the current page of employee data
    response = requests.get(url + f'&page={page}')
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f'Error retrieving employee data (page {page})')
        break

    # Process the employee data for the current page
    employee_data = response.json()
    # Do something with the employee data

    # Check if there are more pages
    if 'link' not in response.headers:
        break
    links = response.headers['link'].split(', ')
    for link in links:
        if 'rel="next"' in link:
            page += 1
            break
        else:
            page = None
    if page is None:
        break
```

This retrieves employee data 50 records at a time and processes each page of data as it is received. Make sure to replace `{subdomain}` and `{api_key}` with your actual BambooHR credentials.
