# Introduction

## Brief overview of Keka HR API

Keka HR API is an Application Programming Interface (API) developed by Keka, a cloud-based human resource management platform. It enables developers to integrate Keka HR with other systems and automate HR processes. With the Keka HR API, developers can access and manipulate data stored in the Keka HR platform, such as employee information, payroll data, and attendance records.
The API follows the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods for data retrieval and modification. It also provides endpoints for handling employee data, attendance data, payroll data, and more.
The Keka HR API is designed to make it easy for developers to integrate Keka HR with their existing systems, allowing them to automate HR processes and improve overall HR efficiency. This can help organizations streamline their HR operations and save time and resources.

## Importance of accessing employee data through API

Accessing employee data through an API has several advantages, including:

1.	Automation

By accessing employee data through an API, organizations can automate many HR processes, such as payroll, time and attendance tracking, and performance evaluations. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors associated with manual data entry.

2.	Integration:

An API allows organizations to integrate their HR systems with other systems, such as payroll systems, time and attendance tracking systems, and performance evaluation systems. This enables organizations to share data and improve collaboration between HR and other departments.

3.	Data accuracy:

API-based access to employee data ensures that the data is up-to-date and accurate, as it is updated in real-time whenever there is a change.

4.	Data security:

API-based access to employee data is more secure than manual data entry, as it reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive employee information.

5.	Better decision-making:

With API-based access to employee data, organizations can obtain valuable insights into their workforce, such as demographic information, performance metrics, and compensation data. This information can be used to make informed decisions about HR policies, staffing, and other HR initiatives.

Overall, accessing employee data through an API is an efficient and effective way for organizations to manage their HR operations and improve the overall quality of their HR data.


## Step 1: Obtain API Key or Access Token

### A. Explanation of Authentication Method Used by Keka HR API

Keka HR API uses OAuth 2.0, which is an open standard for secure API authorization. This means that before making API requests, you must obtain an API key or access token that acts as a bearer token to authenticate your API requests.

### B. How to Generate or Obtain API Key or Access Token

To generate or obtain an API key or access token for the Keka HR API, follow these steps:

1. Register for an account on the Keka HR platform.

Access the developer portal at https://developers.keka.com/ and click on Get Started button.

2. Log in to your account and navigate to the API section of your account settings.

3. Generate an API key or access token by following the instructions provided by Keka HR.

4. Store the API key or access token securely.


### C. Importance of Secure Storage of API Key or Access Token

API keys and access tokens are sensitive information that should be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access to the Keka HR platform. If an API key or access token is compromised, an attacker may be able to access sensitive employee data, such as payroll information, attendance records, and personal information.

To ensure the security of your API key or access token, it is important to store it in a secure location, such as a password manager, and to never share it with anyone. Additionally, you should periodically rotate your API key or access token to further enhance security.

## III. Step 2: Make API Request
### A. Explanation of API Endpoint for Employee Data

The API endpoint for employee data in Keka HR is a URL that allows developers to retrieve or modify employee data stored in the Keka HR platform. The endpoint URL will typically include a specific path, such as "/employees" that indicates the type of data that will be accessed. For example https://api.keka.com/v1/employees which returns a list of all employees in the Keka HR system.


### B. Overview of Request Format

Keka HR API supports the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods for data retrieval and modification. To retrieve employee data, a GET request can be made to the API endpoint. A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server, and it does not modify the data on the server.

### C. Explanation of Required Parameters in the Request

When making a GET request to the Keka HR API, the following parameters are typically required:

1. API key or access token:
This parameter is required for authentication and allows the server to verify that the request is coming from an authorized source.

2. Endpoint URL:
This parameter specifies the API endpoint for the employee data that will be accessed.

3. Query parameters:
Depending on the endpoint, additional query parameters may be required to filter or sort the data that is returned.

The header should be formatted as Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY_OR_ACCESS_TOKEN>.

### D. Sample Code for Making the API Request

Here is an example of how to make a GET request to the Keka HR API using Python and the requests library:

```python
import requests

# Replace "API_KEY" with your actual API key or access token
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer API_KEY"
}

# Replace "API_ENDPOINT" with the actual API endpoint for employee data
response = requests.get("API_ENDPOINT", headers=headers)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Print the response data
    print(response.json())
else:
    # Print an error message
    print("Request failed with status code", response.status_code)
```

This code makes a GET request to the API endpoint for employee data, passing in the API key or access token in the request headers. The response data is returned in JSON format, which can be parsed and used in your application as needed.

## IV. Step 3: Parse API response

### A. Explanation of response format (e.g. JSON):

Keka HR API typically returns data in JSON format, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for APIs.

### B. Overview of data structure of employee data in response:

The data structure of the employee data returned by the Keka HR API will depend on the endpoint used and the parameters passed in the API request. Typically, the data will be returned as a JSON object, with each employee represented as a separate object within the response data.

### C. Explanation of how to extract required information from the response:

To extract required information from the API response, you can use the built-in functions and libraries for parsing JSON data in your programming language. In Python, you can use the json library to parse the response data and access the information that you need.

### D. Sample code for parsing the response and extracting information (e.g. using Python):

Here is an example of how to parse the API response and extract the name and email address of each employee using Python:

```python
import json

# Load the response data as a JSON object
response_data = json.loads(response.text)

# Loop through each employee in the response data
for employee in response_data["employees"]:
    # Extract the name and email address of the employee
    name = employee["name"]
    email = employee["email"]

    # Print the name and email address
    print("Name:", name)
    print("Email:", email)
```

This code loads the API response data as a JSON object and loops through each employee in the response data. For each employee, the code extracts the name and email address and prints them to the console. You can modify this code as needed to extract the information that you require for your application.

## V. Handle Pagination in Response

### A. Explanation of pagination in API response:

Pagination is a technique used by APIs to split large amounts of data into smaller, manageable chunks. When the API returns a response with a large amount of data, it may split the data into multiple pages, with each page containing a portion of the total data.

### B. Overview of pagination parameters in the response (e.g. "next" page link):

In the API response, there will usually be parameters included that indicate the current page and the number of pages in the response, as well as a "next" page link that can be used to retrieve the next page of data. The exact format of these parameters will depend on the API, but they are typically included in the header or the body of the response.

### C. Sample code for handling pagination in response (e.g. making additional API requests until all pages have been retrieved):

Here is an example of how to handle pagination in the API response using Python:

```python
import requests
import json

# Initialize the API endpoint URL
endpoint_url = "https://api.keka.com/v1/employees"

# Initialize the page number and "next" page link
page_number = 1
next_page_link = endpoint_url

# Continue making API requests until all pages have been retrieved
while next_page_link is not None:
    # Make the API request
    response = requests.get(next_page_link, headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer " + api_key
    })

    # Load the response data as a JSON object
    response_data = json.loads(response.text)

    # Loop through each employee in the response data
    for employee in response_data["employees"]:
        # Extract the name and email address of the employee
        name = employee["name"]
        email = employee["email"]

        # Print the name and email address
        print("Name:", name)
        print("Email:", email)

    # Increment the page number
    page_number
```

This code initializes the API endpoint URL and the page number, and then enters a loop that continues until all pages have been retrieved. In each iteration of the loop, the code makes an API request using the "next" page link, parses the response data, and extracts the information that is required. The "next" page link is updated in each iteration, so that the next page of data can be retrieved. If there is no "next" page link in the response, the loop will exit and the code will stop making API requests.

## VI. Error handling

### A. Explanation of common error responses (e.g. 401 Unauthorized):

API responses can include error messages in the event of a failure. Some common error responses include:

401 Unauthorized: This error occurs when the API key or access token provided in the request is invalid.
400 Bad Request: This error occurs when the API request is malformed or contains invalid parameters.
404 Not Found: This error occurs when the API endpoint or resource being requested does not exist.
500 Internal Server Error: This error occurs when there is a server-side issue with the API.

### B. Importance of checking the status code of the API response:

It is important to check the status code of the API response to determine if the API request was successful or if an error occurred. The status code provides a concise and consistent way to understand the outcome of the API request, allowing the code to respond appropriately in the event of an error.

### C. Sample code for handling error response:

Here is an example of how to handle error responses in Python:

```python
import requests
import json

# Make the API request
response = requests.get(endpoint_url, headers={
    "Authorization": "Bearer " + api_key
})

# Check the status code of the response
if response.status_code != 200:
    # If the status code indicates an error, raise an exception
    raise Exception("API request failed with status code: " + str(response.status_code))

# Load the response data as a JSON object
response_data = json.loads(response.text)

# Extract the required information from the response
# ...

```

This code makes the API request and checks the status code of the response. If the status code indicates an error (i.e., not equal to 200), the code raises an exception with a message indicating the error. If the status code is 200 (i.e., success), the code continues to parse the response data and extract the required information.

## VII. Conclusion

### A. Recap of the steps for accessing employee data from Keka HR API:

Obtain API key or access token: This step involves generating or obtaining an API key or access token from Keka HR. The API key or access token is required for authentication when making API requests.

Make API request: This step involves constructing and sending an API request to the endpoint for employee data. The API request should include the API key or access token in the header, and any required parameters in the URL or as data in the request body.

Parse API response: This step involves processing the API response to extract the employee data. The response is typically in JSON format, and can be parsed using a JSON parsing library in the programming language of your choice.

Handle pagination in response: Some API responses may contain a large amount of data, so the data may be paginated. To retrieve all the data, you will need to make multiple API requests, using the "next" page link provided in the API response.

Error handling: It is important to handle error responses from the API, as the API may return errors for various reasons (e.g., invalid API key, malformed API request, etc.). The code should check the status code of the API response, and raise an exception or take some other action if an error occurs.

### B. Final thoughts on the importance of accessing employee data through API:

Accessing employee data through an API provides a convenient and efficient way to retrieve and process employee data, as it eliminates the need for manual data entry or data extraction from spreadsheets. This can help save time, reduce errors, and improve the accuracy of the data.

In addition, using an API to access employee data provides a consistent and standardized way to retrieve data, which can make it easier to integrate the data into other systems and applications.

However, it is important to be aware of the security implications of accessing employee data through an API, and to store the API key or access token securely. Additionally, it is important to handle error responses and pagination correctly, in order to ensure that all the data is correctly retrieved and processed.
